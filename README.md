### Ecommerce Web
# You can view the page here:  [Ecommerce Web](https://aitordsgn.github.io/EcommerceWeb/)
I have been following a youtube tutorial playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9bD98LkBR7P8MYh0RzNSHgeVNTA8g0nB

The base web has been made by following that tutorial, but now I am implementing changes on my own.

-  **Languages :** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON
- This web is responsive for Medium & Small devices

The changes that **I made by my own** will be the next one:
- Read an ".json" file for making an automatic product reader.
